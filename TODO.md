## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create the full directory structure under devsecops-vulnerable-app/.
- [x] In app/: Add a clone.sh script to download OWASP Juice Shop source code.
- [x] In docker/: Create a hardened Dockerfile for building a secure container image.
- [x] In .github/workflows/: Develop ci-cd.yml GitHub Actions workflow with security scans.
- [x] In k8s/: Create Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yml, service.yml, networkpolicy.yml, rbac.yml).
- [x] In terraform/: Write IaC files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf).

# DevSecOps Vulnerable App Project - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create the full directory structure under devsecops-vulnerable-app/.
- [x] In app/: Add a clone.sh script with ultra-strong error handling (version checks, disk space, internet fallback).
- [x] In docker/: Create a hardened Dockerfile for building a secure container image.
- [x] In .github/workflows/: Develop ci-cd.yml GitHub Actions workflow with security scans.
- [x] In k8s/: Create Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yml, service.yml, networkpolicy.yml, rbac.yml).
- [x] In terraform/: Write IaC files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf).
- [x] In scripts/: Add utility scripts (build.sh, deploy.sh) with ultra-strong error handling.
- [x] In reports/: Include example security scan report placeholders.
- [x] Root level: Create .gitignore, comprehensive README.md, and requirements.txt with all system prerequisites.
- [x] Add ultra-strong error handling to all scripts (version validation, prerequisite checks, cleanup traps, timeout handling).
- [x] Include detailed troubleshooting and setup instructions in README.md.
- [x] Create modern purple hacker-style frontend theme with cyberpunk aesthetics.
- [x] Add theme application script with dynamic CSS/JS injection for OWASP Juice Shop.
- [x] Implement comprehensive edge case handling (old tool versions, insufficient resources, network issues).

## Pending Tasks (For Manual Testing)
- [ ] Test the CI/CD pipeline locally (using act tool if available).
- [ ] Verify Docker build and run basic security checks.
- [ ] Test Kubernetes deployment locally (using minikube or kind).
- [ ] Run Terraform plan and validate with tfsec.
- [ ] Ensure all security tools are integrated and produce expected outputs.
- [ ] Update documentation with any additional setup requirements discovered during testing.
